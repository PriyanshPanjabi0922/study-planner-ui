# Study Planner UI

A clean and minimal **study planner landing page** built using HTML and CSS.  
This project focuses on visual structure, clarity, and layout — not interactivity.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to explore how a study planning interface can be presented clearly using only static web technologies.

It emphasizes:
- Clear weekly structure
- Visual status indication (Completed / Active / Pending / Upcoming)
- Distraction-free layout suitable for future expansion

## Features

- Hero section with conceptual illustration
- Weekly study overview with task status labels
- Product-style feature explanations
- Clean visual hierarchy and section separation
- Dark-themed, minimal UI focused on readability

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Live Demo

## Notes

This is a **static UI project** intended to demonstrate layout thinking and structure.  
Future versions may include JavaScript for interactivity, progress tracking, and dynamic updates.
